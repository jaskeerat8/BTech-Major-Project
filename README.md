* Project developed during Bachelors as part of a major project. 
* Used IOT devices to simulate how data logs will be processed and consumed in real time from the device to the server where a MySQL Database is hosted.
* The output results of latitude and longitude can be converted into addresses.
* These addresses can then be used for data visualisation. A sample can be viewed here: https://jaskeerat8.github.io/BTech-Major-Project/Stolen%20Vehicle%20visualization.html
